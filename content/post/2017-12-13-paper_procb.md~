In this study, Dr. Laura Alencar explores if the evolution of arboreality in vipers
affects species and morphological diversification regimes. We found out that although arboreal vipers
evolve under a more constrained morphological trajectories compared to terrestrial vipers, 
speciation rates remain similar. This study was part of her PhD thesis, and was featured 
in the cover of Proceedings B with a beautiful image by one of the authors, Marcio Martins.
