# Biography

I am a (now official) postdoctoral fellow at the University of São Paulo. My main interests are related to how biological interactions affect the diversification dynamics of different groups. I am also interested in how other biotic and abiotic factors affect the diversification of land vertebrates, as well as trying to understand how some groups can achieve a huge species diversity.

I am also interested in method development and performance testing. Lastly, I am an open science enthusiast, and want to start blogging about it, general science and my personal interests in the near future.
