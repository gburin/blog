I teach the following grad-level courses at Universidade de São Paulo:

- BIE5751: Macroevolução - Teoria e Aplicação (with Tiago Quental and Laura Alencar)

The tutorials that we used during the course are avaliable <a href="https://resources.gburin.com" target="_blank">here (in portuguese)</a>. I will upload the slides from the classes soon.
